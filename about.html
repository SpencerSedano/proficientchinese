					<p>
						Hi, I'm Spencer Sedano. I was born in 1999. I'm from Lima, Peru.
						I've been interested in Chinese since I was 17 years old. The first
						approach that I had with the language was when I was studying
						English at a Language Institute. I met very good friends from China
						and started learning phrases. Currently, I'm still studying at a
						Language Institute, no English but Chinese.

					<p>
						Hello, my full name is Spencer Sedano Velasco, I was born in Lima,
						Peru in 1999. Currently, I'm 21 years old, I'm living with my mother
						and older brother. My father passed away when I was 19 years old
						because he was sick for a few months, cancer sucks. <br />
						Because of him I learned English, then I met people from China at my
						Language Institute where I was studying English, these Chinese
						people became my very good friends. I used to hang out with them a
						lot, going out to eat Chinese food, I started learning phrases
						because I wanted to communicate better with them. I was 17 years old
						at that time. <br />
						Now, I'm currently striving to get fluent at Chinese, and go to
						China to study University. I want to pursue a carrer in Technology,
						I want to become a Software Engineer.
