						Find a Good Step-by-Step Book or Resource
					</h3>
					<p>
						There are a lot of resources on the Internet that you can find. A
						good start can be the book called "HSK Standard Course". HSK stands
						for 汉语水平考试，where 汉语*(hànyǔ) means Chinese, 水平(shuǐpíng)
						means level, and 考试(kǎoshì) means exam. Basically HSK is an
						international exam so you can have proof that you actually know
						Chinese. It's similar to the TOEFL or CAE in English. Remember you
						will start learning Pinyin which is the romanization system for
						Chinese, that's how you learn how to pronounce words and
						pronunciation in Chinese is really <b>really</b> important. HSK
						Standard Course 1 is a good start.
					</p>

					/></a>
					<h3 class="resume-title">Review Vocabulary Every Day</h3>
					<p>
						The second step is key. Whatever you learn, it is normal that you
						forget. Think about when you studied for an exam, do you still
						remember? Well, it is because when we studied for an exam, most of
						us studied to pass it and then we didn't have the need to review it.
						<br />
						My recommendation here it's to start using a spaced repetition
						software, the best one for me is Anki. Spaced repetition is a
						technique for fast and long-lasting memorization, that's what we
						need when studying Chinese! Please take a look at
						<a class="colorful-link" href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"
							>Anki's website.</a
						>
						Try it, it helps a lot and not only for Chinese! It's basically for
						remembering information.

					<h3 class="resume-title">Find a Speaking Partner</h3>
					<p>
						Everything you've learned so far needs to be applied. How do you
						apply it? Using it! Try and find someone you can write and speak
						Chinese. There is an app called HelloTalk, you can download it to
						your cellphone and exchange your language, you can help Chinese
						people with your English or Spanish, and they will help you out with
						your Chinese.
						<br />
						There is also another app I've heard which is Tandem, you can also
						try it. I've heard it's pretty good!
					</p>
					<img class="article-images" src="./images/hellotalk.png" alt="" />
					<h3 class="resume-title">Regular Chinese Classes</h3>
					<p>
						It's a really hard task to study by yourself. You know yourself, and
						if you feel that you won't do it. Don't hesitate on looking for
						regular Chinese classes and you can do everything from the above as
						an additional resource for your studies.
